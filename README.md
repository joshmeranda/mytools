# MyTools

A collection of tools and things. Use if you like!

## Dependencies

For most of these tools I try to stick to pure bash and coreutils, but sometimes that just is not possible or practical. Below are the tools that will let you run all tools:

| Name | Version | Links |
| ---- | ------- | ----- |
| git  | 2.34.1  | https://github.com/rancher/rancher-docs/pull/1852 |
| jq   | 1.6     | https://github.com/jqlang/jq?tab=readme-ov-file#installation |

Versions are what I have developed and tested the scripts. Feel free to use other versions at your own risk.
